Here is the audisktool program I wrote for my Software Construction in Spring 2012 class at Auburn.

Few things:
-I have included the orignal project description of implementation, it is 10 pages... so here is a short but sweet version of the project. 
	Create a tool that will monitor disk reads and writes. 
	The tool must have
	1. A simple text interface, with a help feature to list commands
	2. Seprate Classes where applicable
	3. The use of a namespace that is not std
	4. Writes the results to a default file or a file indicated by user
	5. A configuration file
	6. A makefile

-I have made a few improvements to the project itself so some discrepancies between the orignal requirments may be seen.

-The executable made from the makefile is called audisktool.
